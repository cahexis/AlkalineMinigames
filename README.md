Project made for resume. smiley face. <br>

This project is a little discord bot that allows you to flip a coin (speaking head emoji for heads, and cat emoji for tails). <br/>
It uses the discord.py library/api wrapper for functionality. <br/>
If you decide to use this, you will need to setup the bot's permissions and its own token.
